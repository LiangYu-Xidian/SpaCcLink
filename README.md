# SpaCcLink: Exploring downstream signaling regulations with graph attention network for systematic inference of spatial cell-cell communication

Cellular communication is vital for the proper functioning of multicellular organisms. A comprehensive analysis of cellular communication demands the consideration not only of the binding between ligands and receptors but also of a series of downstream signal transduction reactions within cells. Nevertheless, the majority of existing spatial cell-cell communication algorithms fail to take into account the downstream signals within cells. In this study, we put forward SpaCcLink, a cell-cell communication analysis method that takes into account the downstream influence of individual receptors within cells and systematically investigates the spatial patterns of communication as well as downstream signal networks.
